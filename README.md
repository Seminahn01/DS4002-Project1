## Section 1: Software and Platform

This project utilizes **Python** and **R** for sentiment analysis on movie reviews and predicting box office revenue. Below is a detailed breakdown of the software, required dependencies, and platform compatibility.

 ### Software Used
- **Python**: Used for sentiment analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.
- **R**: Used for data scraping and preprocessing.

### Required Add-On Packages
Before running the scripts, install the following dependencies.

### Python Dependencies
Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed. Required packages include:

- **Data Handling & Analysis:** `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** `nltk`, `vaderSentiment`, `TfidfVectorizer`
- **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
- **Statistical Modeling:** `statsmodels`
- **Utility & Web Scraping:** `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`

### R Dependencies
Ensure you have **R 4.0+** installed. Required packages include:

Web Scraping & Data Wrangling: tidyverse, rvest, dplyr

To install them in R, run:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rvest", "dplyr"))

### Platform Compatibility
This project is compatible with the following operating systems:

- **Windows**
- **MacOS**
- **Linux**
All scripts and dependencies should run smoothly across these platforms. Make sure you have the correct versions of Python and R installed before proceeding with the analysis.
